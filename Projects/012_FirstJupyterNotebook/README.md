## Fork & Clone this repository

* We did this in a previous assignment. Instructions are here: https://github.com/cmcntsh/N6806_Fall2020_DevNotes/blob/master/Projects/002%20-%20Practice%20Using%20Git%20and%20GitHub/README.md

## Create a new Conda environment for this assignment.

* [ ] In an editor of your choice (i.e. VSCode) edit this README.md file to add the answers requested in the tables.

  * He installs Miniconda. We will be using Anaconda. Don't install Miniconda.
  * Follow along with the rest of the tutorial.
  * Go ahead and create the environments as he creates them in the tutorial.
