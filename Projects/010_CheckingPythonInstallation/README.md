# Checking Your Python (Anaconda) Installation

## Skills in this exercise

1. Use the command line.
2. Fork this repository so you can work on your own copy.
3. Edit this README.md file.
4. Push your updated file to your GitHub repository.

## Summary of steps to complete

- [ ] Fork this repository so you have your own copy to work on.
- [ ] Clone the repository on your local machine. 
- [ ] Check your version of Python using an Anaconda Prompt and a regular Command Prompt
- [ ] Edit this README.md file on your machine.
- [ ] Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
- [ ] Submit a link to this GitHub repository in Canvas.

## 1. Fork & Clone

* We did this in a previous assignment. Instructions are here: https://github.com/cmcntsh/N6806_Fall2020_DevNotes/blob/master/Projects/002%20-%20Practice%20Using%20Git%20and%20GitHub/README.md

## Edit your README.md file

* In an editor of your choice (i.e. VSCode) edit this README.md file to add the answers requested in the tables.

## Check version

* [ ] Open an Anaconda Prompt.
* [ ] Check your python version by running the code `python --version`
* [ ] Enter the result in the table below.
* [ ] Open a regular Command Prompt.
* [ ] Check your python version by running the code `python --version`
* [ ] Enter the result in the table below.

|   Command   |         Result          |
|     ---     |           ---           |
|`python --version` in Anaconda Prompt         |(enter result here)|
|`python --version` in regular Command Prompt  |(enter result here)|

* If you didn't get a result in the regular command prompt, it means Python didn't get added to your path variable.
* It's not strictly necessary. It just means you should run Python from the CLI using Anaconda Prompt instead of a regular command prompt. Or you need to add the path to Python to your path variable.

## Find your path to Python interpreter

* Instruction on how to find the path to the Python interpreter in Anaconda can be found here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/python-path/
